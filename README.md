# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic hand game played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: a rock (fist), paper (open hand), or scissors (index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The outcome is determined by the choices made:

Rock crushes scissors (rock wins)
Scissors cuts paper (scissors win)
Paper covers rock (paper wins)
If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie and is often played again. It's a simple and fun game of chance, often used as a quick decision-making tool or for entertainment


this project is built with implementation of  Functions, objects, local Storage , and Onpage result , at every stage one after other to demonstrate the changes in project after implementation of each technique.
